## 1. Introduction

Let's go to JS

## 2. How to run JavaScript code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script>
    // Your JavaScript goes here!
    console.log("Hello, World!")
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Another way to include JavaScript in a webpage is through an external script. This is very similar to linking external CSS docs to your website.

```js
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

## 3. Variables

You can think of variables as simply "storage containers" for data in your code.

## 4. Numbers

Numbers are the building blocks of programming logic! In fact, it’s hard to think of any useful programming task that doesn’t involve at least a little basic math.

1. [This W3Schools lesson](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp) followed by [this one](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp), are good introductions to what you can accomplish with numbers in JavaScript.

2. [This MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math) covers the same info from a slightly different point of view, while also teaching you how to apply some basic math in JavaScript.

3. Read through [this article](http://javascript.info/operators) about operators in Javascript.
